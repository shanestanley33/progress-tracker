## Future plans: 
1. turn fitness tracker into a template and add more templates options like grocery list/cost tracker.
2. add bar graph so users can see progress of their trackers.
3. add measuring tools: Kg and lbs. for fitness tracker, $cost/budgeting for grocery trackers, etc...
4. work on better understanding how a site links up with a apple watch or other wearable.
5. add a way for users to submit questions/comments/suggestions/constructive criticisms.
