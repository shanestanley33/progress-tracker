2. add bar graph so users can see progress of their trackers progress.
3. add measuring tools: Kg and lbs. for fitness tracker, $cost/budgeting for grocery trackers, etc...
4. work on better understanding how a ite lins up with a apple watch or other wearable.
5. add a way for users to submit questions/comments/suggestions/constructive criticisms.
